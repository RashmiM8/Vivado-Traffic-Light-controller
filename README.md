Traffic Light Controller (Verilog HDL)

This project implements a Traffic Light Controller using Verilog HDL, designed and simulated in Xilinx Vivado.
It demonstrates fundamental RTL design, simulation, and verification concepts.

🧩 Project Structure
src/   → Verilog source files (design modules)
tb/    → Testbench files
sim/   → Waveform configuration (.wcfg)

⚙️ How to Run the Project

Open Xilinx Vivado.

Create a new project.

Add the Verilog files from src/.

Add the testbench files from tb/.

Run behavioral simulation.

(Optional) Load the .wcfg file from the sim/ folder to view the waveform.

✨ Features

Implements a fully functional traffic light sequence (Red → Yellow → Green).

Designed in Verilog HDL and simulated using Vivado Simulator.

Includes testbench verification with timing-based transitions.

Demonstrates basic FSM (Finite State Machine) design concepts.

📈 Future Scope

Add pedestrian crossing functionality.

Implement parameterized timing control.

Extend design for multiple intersections.
