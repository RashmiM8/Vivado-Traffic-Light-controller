Traffic Light Controller (Verilog HDL)

This project implements a Traffic Light Controller using Verilog HDL, designed and simulated in Xilinx Vivado.
It demonstrates fundamental RTL design, simulation, and verification concepts.

🧩 Project Structure
src/   → Verilog source files (design modules)
tb/    → Testbench files
sim/   → Waveform configuration (.wcfg)

⚙️ How to Run the Project

1.Open Xilinx Vivado.

2.Create a new project.

3.Add the Verilog files from src/.

4.Add the testbench files from tb/.

5.Run behavioral simulation.

6.(Optional) Load the .wcfg file from the sim/ folder to view the waveform.

✨ Features

- Implements a fully functional traffic light sequence (Red → Yellow → Green).

- Designed in Verilog HDL and simulated using Vivado Simulator.

- Includes testbench verification with timing-based transitions.

- Demonstrates basic FSM (Finite State Machine) design concepts.

📈 Future Scope

- Add pedestrian crossing functionality.

- Implement parameterized timing control.

- Extend design for multiple intersections.
